This directory contains all emulator save states used during the testing.
The training script will randomly pick one of them at appropriate times (e.g. death of Mario).
You have to create them by playing the game and saving the game state via "File -> Save -> State".
Filenames must end in `.lsmv`, otherwise the name can be freely chosen.
